# React Routes Practice

Now that we've got the handle of creating components, let's work on creating a more dynamic site where the user can navigate to different pages. For this we are going to use the **react-router-dom** package. 
Go ahead and follow the instructions below.

- Clone [THIS]() repository. It contains the necessary files to have a 4 page site.

-  Read the  [documentation](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/example/basic) for the _react-router-dom_ package.

- In **index.js**, implement a navigation menu (styling is optional for this). Your navigation menu should have **four** links:
    - Home ( blank page with _only_ the navigation menu )
    - Happy
    - Sleepy
    - Guilty

- Each link in your navigation needs to **route** to the corresponding _Component_ view.

Your page should look something like [THIS](http://nervous-montalcini-7be7c0.netlify.com/).

- When completed, add and commit your changes and **push** to github.

- Submit the URL to your repository once you complete the exercise.
